Week 2 Challenge - Personal Portfolio
## Description
This is a personal portfolio created within 3 weeks of knowing nothing about coding.  This is the first iteration of what will be much nicer over time as my skills and knowlege of web development increase.
The images are placeholders because in the management of time, the priority was meeting technical requirements.
