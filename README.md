# SKMPortfolio
Week 2 Challenge - Personal Portfolio
## Description
This is the first iteration of what will develop over time as my skills and knowlege of web development increase.
The images are placeholders because in the management of time, the priority was meeting technical requirements.  I look forward to using better graphics for a more professional presentation.
## Approach
First I did the HTML and CSS for the header and navigation.  Then I made the first section.  After the first section, I copied that code twice to make two more sections. Then I modified it to fit the sections.  (i.e. change about content to projects and contact content.)
## Sources that helped me

 - Youtube @EasyTutorialsVideo "How to Make a Prtfolio Website using HTML CSS JS" helped get me started and give me some ideas.

  - Mozilla and W3Schools Websites

  - Inspected random websites to see how they were styled and structured.

   - I looked at other portfolio websites on the public repositories in GitHub.

   - I used the app, Canva to produce some images and the background image
